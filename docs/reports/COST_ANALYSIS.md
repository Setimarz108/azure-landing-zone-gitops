## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Environment-Specific Sizing
```hcl
# Development: Minimal resources
log_retention_days = 90
monthly_budget = 50

# Production: Full enterprise features  
log_retention_days = 365
monthly_budget = 200
2. Automated Cost Controls

Budget Alerts: 80%, 100%, 150% thresholds
Policy Enforcement: VM size restrictions in non-prod
Resource Tagging: Mandatory cost center allocation
Automated Shutdown: Dev environment policies

Budget Management
Monthly Budget Allocation
Development:    €50/month  (€600/year)
Staging:        €100/month (€1,200/year)  
Production:     €200/month (€2,400/year)
Total Annual:   €4,200/year
ROI Analysis
ROI Calculation
ROI = (Annual Savings - Annual Costs) / Initial Investment
ROI = (€31,000 - €4,200) / €4,200 = 638%

Payback Period = 1.5 months
